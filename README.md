Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans for its customers and would like to modernize its operations. Artemis Financial is looking to protect its organization from external threats.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I did well to adhere to industry standard coding practices when I found the client's software security vulnerabilities. This allowed me to fix any issues without any doubts of further security breaches. It is important to code securely, as secure coding practices make for the best and most secure programs. If there are any doubts about a company's security, then customers may not want to utilize that company due to the risk of personal information being lost or breached. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part of the vulnerability assessment that was most helpful to me was the dependency check. Instead of having to go through each dependency manually, I was able to see all known vulnerabilities and the best ways to fix those issues.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

The main way that I was able to increase security was by updating the dependencies that were vulnerable, as this was the most surefire method to ensure that the program's security was as tight as possible. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran dependency checks before and after refactoring the code to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced from my refactoring. On top of that, I was able to figure out which dependencies were vulnerable and needed some additional updating. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The Maven dependency check is something that I will take with me for future assignments and tasks.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I believe that I will be able to show employers that I can successfully check programs for their vulnerabilities, as well as refactor code without introducing any new vulnerabilities. I believe that this is a skill that a possible future employer would be more than happy to see.
